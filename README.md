## What is Oxygen OS:
It is a pure (No bloatware), light OS written in rust designed to be as fast as possible while still maintaining key features. As well as that it is fully custom and doesnt relate to linux.
## When will development start?
We will start the development of the OS in January 2025. When we have learnt how to do it. You could also help us with development before and during this time.
## Key features:
## Warnings!
Only use as a virtual machine (Virtual Box, Vm Ware)
Custom made rust bootloader, and kernel. We might even add a GUI if we have time but untill then it will only be commandline based. The basic features will be the same as my other project Terminal-Emulator-Python.
## Contibuting:
Oxygen OS is a huge project with goals unobtianable by one,
So we ask you please help use achieve our goal, even if its spell checking to even a whole bootloader, all contributions are appreciated!
## Why help?
When you help Oxygen OS with issues and further development. We will be able to push new versions faster as well it will include features built by you.
## Why Rust?
Rust is a fast low level language that is far easier to understand and program than assembly.
It makes it easier for the community to help us.
It makes development faster.
## Why are we doing this?
We want to learn rust aswell as system softwares. 
We want a new style of OS other than the big 3 (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
## Who will use this?
Depending on what the OS will be able to do we would only recomend this to people who just want to try it or are helping develop it.
